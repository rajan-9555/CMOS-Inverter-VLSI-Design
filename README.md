# CMOS Inverter – VLSI Design & Custom Layout

This repository presents the complete VLSI design flow of a CMOS inverter
implemented using Cadence Virtuoso. The project covers schematic design,
symbol creation, custom layout, and physical verification.

## Project Overview
A CMOS inverter is the fundamental building block of digital integrated
circuits. In this project, the inverter is designed using complementary
PMOS and NMOS transistors to achieve correct logic inversion and reliable
operation.

## Design Flow
The following steps are covered in this project:
- Schematic design of CMOS inverter
- Symbol creation for hierarchical use
- Custom layout implementation
- Design Rule Check (DRC)
- Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification
- Functional simulation and waveform analysis

## Key Concepts
- CMOS inverter operation
- PMOS and NMOS transistor sizing
- Basic custom layout techniques
- Layout symmetry and cleanliness
- DRC and LVS clean design practices
- Awareness of layout parasitics
